## 📋 What is this?

The Euler–Mascheroni constant is important in mathematics. However, its float64 representation can use a lot of memory. This tool helps you use a smaller float16 approximation, saving you space and improving performance in specific use cases.

## ⚙️ Features

- Simple float16 approximation of the Euler–Mascheroni constant.
- Lightweight in memory usage.
- Works well with JavaScript and Node.js applications.
- Good for educational purposes or in mathematical computations where precision isn't critical.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- Any operating system that can run Node.js (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Node.js version 12.0 or higher installed on your machine to run the script.
